        "Although the `cycles` variable was updated to `3 * self.size - 1` as per the task's instructions, the 3x3 matrix multiplication result still did not match the ground truth. This indicates that the issue was not solely the number of simulation cycles, but rather a fundamental problem in how the `SystolicArray.multiply` method simulated the data flow between `ProcessingElement` (PE) units.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Identified Bug in Data Flow:**\n",
        "The original `multiply` method incorrectly simulated the parallel nature of a systolic array. It attempted to propagate data (specifically `a_out` and `b_out` from one PE) to its neighbor (`a_inputs[i][j+1] = a_out` and `b_inputs[i+1][j] = b_out`) *within the same clock cycle loop*. In a true synchronous systolic array, each PE operates based on the data it received in the *previous* clock cycle. This means all inputs to all PEs for a given cycle must be determined from the state of the PEs at the *end of the previous cycle*, before any PE performs its current cycle's operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How the Fix Resolves the Discrepancy:**\n",
        "The corrected implementation will modify the `multiply` method to accurately reflect synchronous data flow:\n",
        "1.  **Gather Inputs:** At the beginning of each cycle, the inputs (`a_in` and `b_in`) for *all* PEs are determined. These inputs either come from external source matrices `A` and `B` (for `j=0` and `i=0` respectively) or from the `a_reg` and `b_reg` of their respective neighboring PEs (which hold the values passed through at the end of the *previous* cycle).\n",
        "2.  **Process PEs in Parallel:** After all inputs for the current cycle are gathered, the `process` method is called for *each* PE. This method correctly uses its *current* `a_reg` and `b_reg` (from the *previous* cycle's inputs) for the multiply-accumulate operation, and then updates its `a_reg` and `b_reg` with the *current cycle's inputs* (for use in the *next* cycle).\n",
        "\n",
        "By ensuring that all PEs use values from the previous cycle's state and then update their internal registers for the subsequent cycle, the simulation accurately models the synchronous, parallel operation of a systolic array, thus resolving the incorrect calculation issue."

After re-tracing the logic, it was identified that `a_out` and `b_out` within the `ProcessingElement.process` method should pass through the *current inputs* (`a_in_for_current_cycle`, `b_in_for_current_cycle`) rather than the *previous cycle's stored values* (`self.a_reg`, `self.b_reg`) to correctly model the data streams. This ensures that `A` and `B` values propagate without an additional delay within each PE, aligning with the skewed input strategy. This fix needs to be applied to the `ProcessingElement` class.\n",

        "**Recap of the Problem:**\n",
        "Despite correcting the `cycles` calculation and introducing intermediate `a_pipe_out_regs`/`b_pipe_out_regs` for synchronous updates, the matrix multiplication results remained incorrect. This indicated a fundamental misunderstanding or misimplementation of how data propagates *within* a `ProcessingElement`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Identified Bug:**\n",
        "In a synchronous systolic array, when an input value (`A` or `B` element) arrives at a `ProcessingElement` (PE) in the current clock cycle, it is immediately available to be passed to the next PE in the pipeline for the *next* cycle. The `multiply-accumulate` (MAC) operation, however, uses the values that were loaded into the PE's internal registers (`a_reg`, `b_reg`) *from the previous clock cycle*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The previous implementation of `ProcessingElement.process` was mistakenly returning `self.a_reg` and `self.b_reg` as `a_out` and `b_out`. This meant the data being passed to the next PE was also delayed by an additional cycle (it was the data that entered *this* PE in the *previous* cycle), leading to incorrect synchronization and results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Corrected Data Flow Logic:**\n",
        "1.  **MAC Operation:** The PE performs `self.accumulator += self.a_reg * self.b_reg`, using the `A` and `B` values held in its internal registers from the *previous* cycle.\n",
        "2.  **Output to Neighbors:** The values `a_in_for_current_cycle` and `b_in_for_current_cycle` (which just arrived at this PE) are immediately passed through as outputs (`a_out`, `b_out`) to the neighboring PEs. This ensures correct pipelined data flow without an extra cycle of delay.\n",
        "3.  **Register Update:** The PE then loads `a_in_for_current_cycle` and `b_in_for_current_cycle` into its `self.a_reg` and `self.b_reg` respectively. These values will be used for the MAC operation in the *next* clock cycle."
